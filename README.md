# HackBio Internship
# Learning Experience
This stage helped me think more intentionally about how biological data is presented. Writing the technical piece pushed me to explain concepts such as color bias and accessibility in genomics in a way that could be understood by both technical and non-technical audiences. It reinforced the idea that clarity is just as important as correctness when communicating scientific results.

Documenting my work also improved how I approached my analysis. Writing things down forced me to be precise about my reasoning and decisions, making the overall process more organized and easier to follow.

In addition, although I have previous experience with R, it's always refreshing to go back to the basics.

One key lesson from this stage is that good science depends on how well ideas and results are communicated. Whether through code, figures, or writing, clarity and accessibility are essential for meaningful biological research.
